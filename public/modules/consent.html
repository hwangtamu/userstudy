    <p><strong>What are some general things you should know about research studies?</strong>
    <br>You are being asked to take part in a research study.
        Joining the study is voluntary.
        You may refuse to join, or you may withdraw your consent to be in the study,
            for any reason, without penalty. <br>
        Research studies are designed to obtain new knowledge.
        This new information may help people in the future.
        You may not receive any direct benefit from being in the research study.
        There also may be risks associated with being in research studies.
        (Find details in question below.)<br>
        Details about this study are discussed below.
        It is important that you understand this information so that you can make an informed decision about being in this research study.
        You can save an electronic copy of this consent form. You should ask the researchers or student research assistants named above any questions you have about this study at any time.</p>


    <p><strong>What is the purpose of this study?</strong>
    <br>The purpose of this research study is to understand what information disclosure is optimal for properly integrating data about people for research while also protecting their privacy during the process.
    </p>

    <p><strong>How many people will take part in this study?</strong>
    <br>Approximately 300 people will participate in the research study.
    </p>

    <br>The study should take no more than 90 minutes.
    </p>

    <p><strong>What will happen if you take part in the study?</strong>
    <br>You will be shown a series of identifying information about FAKE people. You will then be asked questions about what you think about the data we show you and your confidence level of your thought.
    </p>

    <p><strong>What are the possible benefits from being in this study?</strong>
    <br>Research is designed to benefit society by gaining new knowledge. Your participation is important to help us understand how to provide privacy protection as well as do good research on people using personal data, but you may not benefit personally from being in this research study.
    </p>


    <p><strong>What are the possible risks or discomforts involved from being in this study?</strong>
    <br>The things that you will be doing are no more than the risks that you would come across in everyday life. We do not think you will experience any discomfort or risk from the study.
